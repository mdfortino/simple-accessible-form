# simple-accessible-form
Create a simple HTML page which includes the following elements: 

* Login (heading)
* Username (label) Username textbox
* Password(label) Password textbox
* Login Button

 Please consider the following optional additions to the exercise. Keep accessibility in mind with regard to all aspects of the sample form.


# Client-side Validation
* Add constraint information for the password field (Ex: Password must include one capital letter, one lower case letter, and at least one number.)
* Check for the username “level” and password of “Access123”.
* If successful, display an alert informing the user that there was a success. Also feel free to redirect to a page with text that says “You have signed in!”
* If unsuccessful, display an error notifying the user that the username/password combination was not recognized.
# Style the form
* Use custom explicit labels.
* Round the form field corners slightly.
* Place the form in a styled area of the page.
* Style the submit button


Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks with which you have experience. Also feel free to add more complex form fields to highlight more difficult implementations.
